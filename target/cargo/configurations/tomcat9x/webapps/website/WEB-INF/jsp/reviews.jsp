                        <font color="#000000" size="4" >Learning was never soo fun specially when it comes to learning a programming language. The lectures are soo damn amazing and interactive and all the credit goes to Hirani Sir. <BR>His knowlege and attitude towards this course makes you want to work harder. Being a Electronic student coding was never my thing but now I can guarantee that I can easily write a code because the fundas are very clear. <BR>Being taught by Hirani Sir is one of the best things that can ever happen to anyone and its too difficult to describe the journey in words.</font></p>

The method of teaching is very well planned, first the basics of java language are covered then a project is made using those concepts.<BR>J2EE is a course which comprises of three stages namely J2ee technologies, spring mvc, spring boot. These stages bridge the gap between our curriculum and the trends in IT industry. From UI to Security everything is taught with an hands on experience. We are made to work on a project and develop a web app out of it using these technologies. This course are again made easy with the help of videos available at techskillsit.com.

I still remember the syntax and the basic concepts of java because of the meticulous and the captivating way in which you taught us. I am from Electronics branch, yet I could understand the concept when you simplified the problems step by step. Thank you for it. :)

Hirani Sir not only helped me get the OCPJP certificate easily but also has helped me get a command over JAVA. <BR>Hirani has always been supportive and the concepts that he has taught are always from the company requirements point of view, which are really very helpfull. <BR>

Thank You Sir for making me grow as a programmer and developer.

Every topic is taught thoroughly not only once but multiple times. You need not be a CSE/IT student to understand as Imitiaz sir starts from the scratch. If one wants to have a great command on java then this course is highly recommended. I can now confidently say that I am a java programmer all thanks to Imitiaz sir.
